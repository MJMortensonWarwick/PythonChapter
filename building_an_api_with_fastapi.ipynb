People have built APIs with Python for some time, and packages such as _flask_ have been popular for doing so. However, in the last couple of years _FastAPI_ has become a very popular solution for this, and will be our chosen package. We need to begin by installing as normal (note we'll be using _pyngrok_ as before):"
